# mingw-w64-texmacs
for building the latest TeXmacs for Windows  (in MSys2/Mingw32 environment)

when running `makepkg`, this will build TeXmacs for Windows from latest svn and package it with utilities not found in the official distribution: 

- a spell checker (with dictionary for English and the locale of the machine where the build is made)

- extra image utilities enabling to use TeXmacs as an equation editor for Inkscape.


The easiest way to build TeXmacs is by using the [fully automated build environment](https://github.com/slowphil/texmacs-win-builder) ([direct download](https://github.com/slowphil/texmacs-win-builder/releases/download/v0.9/texmacs-win-sdk-installer-0.91.7z.exe))


# Ready-made resulting builds can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/slowphil/mingw-w64-texmacs/releases)
